    name: "What are the benefits of sourdough bread?",
    text: "Bread in the starter is useful primarily due to its natural composition. The sourdough from which this kind of bread is prepared is a mixture of water and flour. In this mixture and the fermentation process takes place with the participation of microorganisms and yeast fungi. Also the bread on the starter contains many beneficial elements, such as vitamins of group B, trace elements (magnesium, zinc, selenium) and fiber. Probiotics! Sourdough bread contains probiotics, which make it a better choice than commercially processed supermarket bread. Probiotics help support the gut microbiome. Probiotics are gut bacteria that help the human digestive system function properly. Common bakery products are usually associated with the development of meteorism. Yeast, causing swelling of the dough and the formation of a large amount of cavities with carbon dioxide in it, lead to abundant gas formation in the intestine. The benefit of bread on the leaven is that it does not cause such phenomena. Phytic acid! Citric acid. It has the property to accumulate in some products (for example, nuts, beans or cereal bran) and have a negative effect on human health. The fermentation process (fermentation, caking), which is carried out by fermented crops, the content of fitates in whole grain bread is reduced by 62%. Compared with standard industrial yeast, only 38%. Lactic acid bacteria present in the yeast increase acidification, which leads to an increased solubility of magnesium and phosphorus. Long-term slow fermentation of wheat can sometimes reduce the number of flutes to 90%! ",

    name: "Is easy to digest",
    text: "Bread on the leaven is easier to digest. This is explained by the fact that when the dough is boiled on the starter, it produces lactic acid, which fully corresponds to human metabolism. On the contrary, when using yeast as a result of fermentation alcohol is produced, which eventually leads to metabolism. Also proved the value of bread on sourdough is that it is better digested and facilitates the digestion process. In large part this is due to its roughness and density: the dense pulp in the food crumb promotes more active intestinal work, thanks to which the work of the digestive tract muscles is activated, the food is better digested, and the intestine itself is trained and becomes healthier. Excellent taste and aroma!Long fermentation (slow fermenting) allows complex flavour and aroma compounds to develop, making the taste of bread deeper. The aroma of bread on the leaven is deep, complex, with notes of sour (milk and vinegar), fruit (green apple), yeast and grain, created by the natural fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeast, which makes its taste rich and expressive, not just a bread. It can vary from a thin creamy to a bright acidic, depending on the type of fermenting and fermentation. Vitamins and microelements! Bread on the coals is beneficial thanks to fermentation, which makes vitamins and minerals more digestible, improves digestion, stabilizes blood sugar levels and contains prebiotics that nourish the intestines. It is rich in B group vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12), vitamin E, selenium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and also a cell that excretes toxins, and organic acids that suppress putrefactive processes in the CTE. Group B vitamins: B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5, B6, folates (B9), B12. Vitamin E. Minerals: Iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, calcium, manganese, selenium, copper, iodine, aluminium, sulphur. Reduces acrylamide! The long-term fermentation process involving bacteria and fermented yeast reduces the production of acrylamide, which is produced by high temperature processing, especially in bread on industrial yeast. Bread on the leaven is useful because fermentation lowers the level of acrylamide (a carcinogenic substance) and also makes minerals more accessible, improves digestibility and reduces glycemic index, which has a beneficial effect on digestion, intestinal microflora and general well-being. The yeast breaks down fitonic acid and gluten, making it easier to assimilate nutrients and make bread suitable for people with gluten sensitivity.",

    name: "Lower glycemic index",
    text: "Low GI: The acids in the yeast slow down the digestion and release of sugar into the blood, unlike the yeasts that quickly «secrete» glucose. Slow rise in sugar: This prevents sudden spikes in glucose, which is harmful with type 2 diabetes. Digestive Improvement: Probiotics contains prebiotics and fiber that nourish the intestines, contributing to better health of the gastrointestinal tract! The nutrients in the bread!The nutrients in the bread on the leaven are more accessible to the body due to fermentation processes that occur during cooking, which contributes to better absorption of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. In addition, the fermentation process destroys the fitonic acid, which often causes diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and prevents mineral absorption. Varied taste! The bread has a rich, multifaceted taste with a characteristic pleasant acidity (from milk and acetic acids), which makes the taste deeper and more expressive. Acidity: This is the main distinguishing feature caused by lactic acid bacteria. It can be light or more palpable, but makes the taste fuller. Saturation: Sour bread has a deep, rich taste and aroma that is often lacking in yeast analogues. Bread is not just bread, but a whole range of flavors that depends on the skill of the baker, quality of the leaven and selected flour, and it feels more natural and useful.",

    name: "How to store bread",
    text: "It is best to store bread at natural room temperature.. If you like to stock up on food, just freeze the bread in slices or whole.. Do not allow high humidity or, on the contrary, too dry air in the house.. Do not store bakery products in plastic containers or bags, use instead wooden bread boxes, paper bags, fabric bags. Thanks to their porous structure, they allow air to pass through and prevent the bread from drying out prematurely or accumulating excess moisture. Cut off exactly as many slices as you need for a meal. At the same time, you need to cut from the middle, first dividing the bread into halves. How to properly freeze bread? Take the bread and send it to the freezer. It can be stored there for 2-3 months without losing its nutritional and taste qualities. Everything you need is put bread in a bag, squeeze out excess air, close tightly and place in the freezer. At the same time, it is important not to subject the product to sharp temperature fluctuations. Therefore, it is often undesirable to remove it from the freezer. If you have frozen sliced bread, remove exactly as many pieces from the refrigerator as needed in the near future. Frozen slices of bread can be heated in the microwave, in a toaster and even just in a pan. And the whole loaf will have to be defrosted in a different way. It is left in a bag at room temperature. Depending on the size of the loaf and the type of bread, it may take from half an hour to three hours to thaw. After that, the product must be baked in the oven to add a fragrant and crispy crust. The oven is heated to 180 degrees, the baking sheet is poured with approximately 100 ml of water, and the loaf is placed on a grate. In such conditions, bread is baked for 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the loaf and your oven. As a result, you will get aromatic pastries with a crispy crust.",
